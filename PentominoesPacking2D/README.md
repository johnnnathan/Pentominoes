# 🧩 Pentominoes

**Version:** `v1.1`  
**Date:** `12/10/2023`

### 🎯 Purpose
**Pentominoes** is a Java-based algorithmic solver that attempts to fill a rectangular grid of any given size using pentomino shapes in the most space-efficient way possible.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download** the ZIP file and unzip it.  
2. **Open** the unzipped folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any Java-compatible IDE.  
3. To run:
   - Compile and execute `BruteForce.java` for the basic brute-force approach.
   - Compile and execute `BranchSolve.java` for a more efficient branch-based solution.

### 🕹️ How to Use

1. After launching the program, type **`start`**.
2. You'll be prompted to decide whether to:
   - Use the **default grid size** of `12x5`, or
   - Enter a **custom grid size** (e.g., `6x10`, `3x20`, etc.).
3. Select which **pentomino pieces** to include in the solution.
4. The program will then output a solution:
   - For custom inputs, it shows a possible tiling.
   - For the default mode, it generates a randomized valid tiling of the `12x5` grid.

### ⚙️ Features
- 📐 Supports arbitrary grid sizes (as long as they fit pentomino constraints)  
- 🤖 Two algorithm modes: brute force and optimized branching  
- 🔀 Randomized tiling option for the default configuration  
- 🧠 Interactive command-line input for full control
