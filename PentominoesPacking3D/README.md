# 🧱 Pentominoes (Knapsack3D) 

**Version:** `v1.2.5`  
**Date:** `22/01/2024`

### 🎯 Purpose
**Knapsack3D** is a visual and algorithmic tool that solves a 3D knapsack-filling problem using both **Cuboids** and **Pentominoes**. The aim is to optimize how space is filled within a 3D volume based on different goals, either maximizing **space usage** or **score**.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download** the ZIP file and unzip it.  
2. **Open** the unzipped folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any Java-compatible IDE.
3. **Compile & Run** the `UI.java` file to launch the graphical menu.

### 🕹️ How to Use

1. Upon launch, you're greeted with a **Start Screen** containing:
   - **Start (Cuboids)**
   - **Start (Pentominoes)**
   - **Exit**

2. Choosing either start option will lead to a 3D interactive menu:
   - **FOR FILL** – Fills the knapsack to minimize empty space.
   - **FOR SCORE** – Fills the knapsack to maximize score, even if it leaves some empty space.

3. After selecting an algorithm:
   - A 3D render of the knapsack layout will appear.
   - You can **rotate** and inspect the model using your mouse.
   - When done, simply **close the window** to return and try other options.
